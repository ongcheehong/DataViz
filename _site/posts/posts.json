Those who do not have company cars have the ability to check out company trucks for business use, but these trucks cannot be used for personal business.\r\nEmployees with company cars are happy to have these vehicles, because the company cars are generally much higher quality than the cars they would be able to afford otherwise. However, GAStech does not trust their employees. Without the employees? knowledge, GAStech has installed geospatial tracking software in the company vehicles. The vehicles are tracked periodically as long as they are moving.\r\nThis vehicle tracking data has been made available to law enforcement to support their investigation. Unfortunately, data is not available for the day the GAStech employees went missing. Data is only available for the two weeks prior to the disappearance.\r\nTo promote local businesses, Kronos based companies provide a Kronos Kares benefit card to GASTech employees giving them discounts and rewards in exchange for collecting information about their credit card purchases and preferences as recorded on loyalty cards. This data has been made available to investigators in the hopes that it can help resolve the situation. However, Kronos Kares does not collect personal information beyond purchases.\r\nAs a visual analytics expert assisting law enforcement, your mission is to identify which GASTech employees made which purchases and identify suspicious patterns of behavior. You must cope with uncertainties that result from missing, conflicting, and imperfect data to make recommendations for further investigation.\r\nQuestions\r\nUsing just the credit and loyalty card data, identify the most popular locations, and when they are popular. What anomalies do you see? What corrections would you recommend to correct these anomalies? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 300 words.\r\nAdd the vehicle data to your analysis of the credit and loyalty card data. How does your assessment of the anomalies in question 1 change based on this new data? What discrepancies between vehicle, credit, and loyalty card data do you find? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.\r\nCan you infer the owners of each credit card and loyalty card? What is your evidence? Where are there uncertainties in your method? Where are there uncertainties in the data? Please limit your answer to 8 images and 500 words.\r\nGiven the data sources provided, identify potential informal or unofficial relationships among GASTech personnel. Provide evidence for these relationships. Please limit your response to 8 images and 500 words.\r\nDo you see evidence of suspicious activity? Identify 1- 10 locations where you believe the suspicious activity is occurring, and why Please limit your response to 10 images and 500 words.\r\nIf you solved this mini-challenge in 2014, how did you approach it differently this year?\r\nInstalling required R pacakages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvided data and information\r\nThere are 3 different types of data & information provided. A geospatial dataset, csv files and a jpg file consisting of the Abila tourist map.\r\nBelow is the information of all the data provided.\r\n1.

As such, we will conduct literature review on past 2014 Vast Challenge submission based on MC2 – Patterns of Life Analysis. We will select some of the past submission to identify some of the gaps that can potentially utilized interactive data visualization techniques to improve user experiences. The repository for 2014 Vast Challenge – MC2: Patterns of Life Analysis submissions can be found here\r\n#Importing of data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 2\r\n  encoding confidence\r\n  <chr>         <dbl>\r\n1 ASCII             1\r\n\r\n#Answers\r\n1.

We are able to see that the credit card dataset has 98 rows more than the loyalty dataset. Based on the given information, the count of credit card purchases should be the same as the count of loyalty cards as both data should be recorded. One assumption to this anomaly might be that those purchases without loyalty data were employees that made purchases without using the Kronos Kares benefit card for unknown reason.\r\nNext, we will change the datatype of last4ccnum and loyaltynum to categorical data and the timestamp for both cc and loyalty data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRows: 1,490\r\nColumns: 4\r\n$ timestamp  <dttm> 2014-01-06

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Crtique of Original Data Visualization\r\n\r\nThe above data visualisation is obtained from the Department of Statistics, Singapore, Singapore International Trade website.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nCritique\r\nSuggestion\r\n1) The chart only shows the 2020 net import and export value. It does not show the value per month which is of more importance to display whether there is growth or decline in trades by comparing with the preceding month. There is no control to allow readers to visualize the increase or decrease of trade between each country per month.\r\nA suggestion is to have a control panel to allow user to select the month & year with added animation to visualize the growth or decline from the preceding month.\r\n2) The chart does not accurately represent what was stated in the caption/sub-title.The caption stated that “Since 2009, the value of exports exceeds imports for Singapore’s merchandise trade with Mainland China.In comparison, the value of imports exceeds exports for Singapore’s trade with United States since 2006.” However, the chart shows the 2020 overall trade with Singapore instead of showing what was stated in the caption.\r\nSimilar to the suggestion in 1), a control panel will allow readers to better visualize the amount of trade from month to month which will make more sense on the caption given.\r\n3) The white dot in the middle of each dot displayed in the chart requires the reader to read before understanding the rationale for it. Additionally, the white dot for those that falls near the x-y axis line will not give the readers a clear picture of whether the export is more than the import or vice versa since the dot covers the 45 degree reference line.\r\nA clearer chart by 1. removing the white dot, 2. making the dots more transparent and 3. making the line more visible by thickening the line will allow readers to instantly understand the chart.\r\n4) The label for each country only displays the net amount for 2020. It does not display any other useful information such as balance of trade, %trade surplus/trade deficit.\r\nA suggestion is to deploy tooltip for every country displayed on the chart with useful information so that readers 1. do not need to reference to the scale to determine the value and 2. able to visualize more useful information.\r\n5) The overlapped markers make it difficult for readers to visualize the real size of the marker. Although the marker was highlighted when the cursor was moved onto it, it does not allow the reader to visualize instantly.Additionally, the 45 degree reference line was covered by the markers making it difficult for readers to visualize whether import is more than export or vice versa.\r\nA suggestion is create transparency on the markers to allow readers to better visualize the marker and also the 45 degree reference line.\r\n6) The bottom import and export scale label does not reflect well on which scale is import and export.\r\nBoth label should be in the middle of the scale to allow readers to clearly understand the meaning of each scale better.\r\n7) The animation of the chart does only to move the marker at its own position making it zooming in and out a bit. This animation does not have any value.\r\nA suggestion will be to allow readers to click onto each marker and a tooltip can pop up to show the import and export value. Additionally, animation can help to reader to visualize the movement of the marker from one month to another month.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nCritique\r\nSuggestion\r\n1) The import and export symbol does not reflect well on the meaning of the symbol.\r\nA suggestion is to remove the symbol completely to avoid any confusion among the readers.\r\n2) Some of the labels are covered by other labels or the markers which make it physically unpleasant looking.\r\nLabels should not be covered by the markers or another label to allow readers to visualize the label more pleasantly.\r\n3) BLue and green does not constrast well with each other.\r\nA suggestion is to use blue and red instead for colour contrast.\r\n4) The label for China is out of the chart which makes it unpleasant for readers to visualize.\r\nA suggestion is to have all markers and labels located inside the chart.\r\n5) As there are too many variables of interest, the huge labels make the whole chart looks cluttered.\r\nA suggestion is to have smaller labels or incorporate a legend to make the chart less cluttered.\r\n2.0 Proposed data visualisation design\r\n\r\nThe proposed design incorporate a clean design with available filter and animation for better user experience and analysis. The proposed design seeks to allow the user to visualize\r\n1.1) the Total trading value of Singapore with regards to its Trade of Balance. The further the markers move beyond the reference line, the higher percentage of trade surplus or deficit from Singapore.\r\n1.2) The Balance of Trade in regards to trade surplus or deficit percentage. The further the markers are from the two zero lines, the higher the trade surplus or deficit. To have a sustainable economy, a country would like to acheive a darker blue which is as far away from the zero line as possible.\r\n1.3) The Import Vs Export where users are able to visualise the gradients between the import and export of a certain country. Similar to both 1.1 and 1.2, a country would like to achieve higher exports vs lower imports which will produce a dark blue line.\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nCritique\r\nProposed improvements\r\n1) The chart only shows the 2020 net import and export value. It does not show the value per month which is of more importance to display whether there is growth or decline in trades by comparing with the preceding month. There is no control to allow readers to visualize the increase or decrease of trade between each country per month.\r\nThe proposed visualisation incorporated a control panel where readers are able to choose the month year of interest and at the same time select the countries of interest.\r\n2) The chart does not accurately represent what was stated in the caption/sub-title.The caption stated that “Since 2009, the value of exports exceeds imports for Singapore’s merchandise trade with Mainland China.In comparison, the value of imports exceeds exports for Singapore’s trade with United States since 2006.” However, the chart shows the 2020 overall trade with Singapore instead of showing what was stated in the caption.\r\nInstead of having a caption, the control panel do a better job in allowing users to visualize what is represented in the chart.\r\n3) The white dot in the middle of each dot displayed in the chart requires the reader to read before understanding the rationale for it. Additionally, the white dot for those that falls near the x-y axis line will not give the readers a clear picture of whether the export is more than the import or vice versa since the dot covers the 45 degree reference line.\r\nThe proposed visualisation incorporate a bold and thicker reference line. Additonally, the markers will be displayed with a certain transparency with borders to show the accurate position of the markers.\r\n4) The label for each country only displays the net amount for 2020. It does not display any other useful information such as balance of trade, %trade surplus/trade deficit.\r\nTooltip will be deployed with useful information such as balance of trade etc.\r\n5) The overlapped markers make it difficult for readers to visualize the real size of the marker. Although the marker was highlighted when the cursor was moved onto it, it does not allow the reader to visualize instantly.Additionally, the 45 degree reference line was covered by the markers making it difficult for readers to visualize whether import is more than export or vice versa.\r\nSame as 3), the markers will be filled with certain transparency and the 45 degree reference line will be thicken with darker colors.\r\n6) The bottom import and export scale label does not reflect well on which scale is import and export.\r\nAll labels will be situated in the middle of the axis to allow user to visualise more easily.\r\n7) The animation of the chart does only to move the marker at its own position making it zooming in and out a bit. This animation does not have any value.\r\nProper animation will be incorporated into the chart to allow users to see the movement of the markers when they switch from month to month and country to country.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nCritique\r\nProposed Improvements\r\n1) The import and export symbol does not reflect well on the meaning of the symbol.\r\nThe proposed visualisation will not incorporate any symbols that does not reflect well on the meaning of the symbol.\r\n2) Some of the labels are covered by other labels or the markers which make it physically unpleasant looking.\r\nTooltip and smaller labels will be use instead of large physical labels.\r\n3) Blue and green does not constrast well with each other.\r\nBlue and Red will be use to differentiate between the markers\r\n4) The label for China is out of the chart which makes it unpleasant for readers to visualize.\r\nAll markers and labels will be within the chart to make it aesthetically beautiful.\r\n5) As there are too many variables of interest, the huge labels make the whole chart looks cluttered.\r\nThe proposed design will heavily make use of tooltips with possible small labels.\r\n3.0 Data Visualisation\r\nThe completed data visualisation using tableau desktop can be accessed through here. Do note to select full screen to have better visibility of the chart.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step data visualisation process\r\n4.1 Data Preparation\r\nDownload and open the excel file downloaded from the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market provided by the Department of Statistic, Singapore (DOS).\r\n\r\nNotice that the above excel sheet has the Subject, Topic and Title on the first three row which is not required in our dataset. As such, we will move the main datasets from row 6 up to the first row. Additionally, we will also rename the sheet “T1” to “Imports” and “T2” to “Exports”\r\n\r\nNext, for better visibility, we will hide those months that are not required on the instruction and only show data from Jan 2011 to Dec 2020.\r\n\r\n4(a). If we give the datasets a look, we will be able to see that most of the countries are in Thousand Dollars. However, the region data as highlighted below is in Million Dollars.\r\n\r\n4(b). As such, we will create six new rows (rows 122 to 137 )at the bottom of the original datasets to modify the region data to Thousand Dollars. First, we will create a dummy number, 1000 at cell PF132. Next, at the first cell (row PF122) of the modified dataset, input the formula **PF3*$PF$132. Lastly, drag the formularize cell to the last cell TU127**\r\n\r\n5(a). Next, notice that the number of the modified dataset is in text datatype. We will change the modified to number with commas in between to be consistent with the rest of the original data.\r\n\r\n5(b). The end result should look like the below image.\r\n\r\nRepeat the same process for the Exports sheet and save the excel file to an appropriate name such as Singapore Merchandise Trade.\r\nNext, we will open up Tableau Prep Builder and connect to our data.\r\n\r\nA panel should emerge. Click the Microsoft Excel on the connect panel and search and access the previously modified Excel file.\r\n\r\nOnce connected. The table pane will show up the sheets that was in the excel file. Drag the Importssheet to the working diagram as shown.\r\n\r\n10(a). An imports panel should show up as shown below.\r\n\r\n10(b). Select out the months (Jan 2011 to Dec 2020) that was within the instructions given. Then click onto the Add a clean step.\r\n\r\n11(a). Next, the clean process panel should show up. Click onto the button (Show Data Grid) beside the search box as shown. Click on the highlighted top rows which is in Million Dollars by pressing Ctrl on your keyboard and click all the Million Dollars rows. Then, proceed to click the Exclude button as shown. This process should remove the rows from your dataset.\r\n\r\n11(b). Next, we will also exclude the bottom rows which include the information of the dataset by doing the same step as above.\r\n\r\n12(a). Next, we will change back to the Profile Pane by clicking on the button below. We will see that there are some na values. We should not exclude that as once we exclude the na values, the whole row will be removed. This will also removed other values within the row. Instead we will change it to 0 for all na values. However, to do that in Tableau Prep Builder, we will be required to change each individual field. To expedite the process, we will head back to our modified dataset in excel and replace the na values with 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n12(b). To replace all na values to 0 in excel. We will need to select the Find & Select under the Home tab. Next, we will need to replace the na values with 0 as shown below. All the na values should have change to 0.\r\n\r\nNext, we will head back to Tableau Prep Builder and refresh the modified data by clicking on the refresh button on the top of the page.\r\n\r\n14(a). Next, we will see that there are some extra spaces under the Variables field in our dataset as shown below.\r\n\r\n14(b). We will remove those extra spaces by doing the following as shown below.\r\n\r\nNext, notice that there are two different total merchandise rows. One is Total Merchandise Imports(Thousand Dollars) the other is Total Merchandise Exports(Thousand Dollars). For us to be able to join this two rows successfully later in Tableau Desktop. We will remove the Imports and Exports from this two rows by renaming them into Total Merchandise Trade(Thousand Dollars).\r\n\r\n16(a). After we have completed the cleaning process. We will pivot our data.This process ensure that certain field is required to be transform from columns to rows for certain data visualization outcome.\r\n\r\n16(b). In our case, we want to change our month from columns into rows to ensure that each value is tag to each month from each country. Below is the process, we will drag all the months by clicking on the 2011 Jan while holding shift and click again on 2020 Dec and dragging it into the Pivoted Fields pane.\r\n\r\n17(a). Next, we will rename the fields after pivoting. The original are shown below.\r\n\r\n17(b). We will rename the “Pivot1 Names” and “Pivot1 Values” to “Year/Month” and “Import Values” respectively\r\n\r\n18(a). Lastly, we will export out our cleaned dataset to csv file. First, we will select the output button by clicking on the + button on the pivot block as shown below.\r\n\r\n18(b). Next, we will output our file as a csv file by the same selection below and click run flow.\r\n\r\nWe will do the same process for the “Exports” sheet. The whole preparation process should look like this below.\r\n\r\n4.2 Further Data Preparation in Tableau Desktop\r\nWe will now open Tableau Desktop and connect our csv data by clicking the More… under the To a File tab.\r\n\r\nNext, we will click on the Imports file that we have prepared. Tableau should automatically list the file onto the Logical Table pane as shown below.\r\n\r\n3(a). We will next drag the Exports file into the logical table as shown below.\r\n\r\n3(b). A Edit Relationship should pop up. Select both Variables and Variables (Exports.csv) and click close. Remember that we need to join Month/Year to fully connect both data together.\r\n\r\n3(c). Next, we will select the Add more fields tab.\r\n\r\n3(d). Lastly, we will select both Year/Month and Year/Month (Exports.csv) as shown below and click the x button on the top right of the pane.\r\n\r\n4.Next, notice that the datatype for Year/Month is in the text form. Change it to the Date form by clicking on the datatype button as shown below.\r\n\r\nThe Variables field is filled with Countries(Thousand Dollars). As we only require the countries, we shal create a new field with only the countries in it by splitting. Click on the small downwards button on the top right of Variables and select split. A new field should show up.\r\n\r\nRename the split field to Country/Region by double clicking on the split field title.\r\n\r\nDo the same for Exports sheet and rename the split field to Country/Regions as there cannot be two same field names from different sheets.\r\nOnce, we have join our dataset. We will switch to Sheet 1 by clicking on the tab below the screen.\r\n\r\n4.3 Singapore Merchandise Trade\r\nNext, we will create a Total Merchandise Trade chart with certain details of Balance of Trade. First, we will drag the Export Values to the Columns and Import Values to the Rows as shown below.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the Country/Regions to the Detail box under the Marks pane. This will shows all the countries and regions in the scatterplot.\r\n\r\n11(a). Next, we will create a Total Trading Value field by selecting the Create Calculated Field under the Analysis tab. This new field will add up both exports and imports value.\r\n\r\n11(b). Input the formula below to create the Total Trading Value field. \r\nNext, we will create another new field called %Surplus/Deficit. This field will allow us to see the percentage surplus or deficit of a country on a certain period.\r\n\r\nAfter the field has been created. We will drag it to the Color box on the Marks pane. Tableau will then show colour representation of each country based on their %Surplus/Deficit.\r\n\r\nNext, we will select the circle symbol from the Marks pane to change the \"“ring plot”\" to scatterplot.\r\n\r\n15(a). Next, we will see that there is a null notification at the bottom right of the chart. The reason for this is because there are more imports countries than exports countries. We are able to remove this by selecting All Records Match under the Edit Relationship in the Data Source panel as shown below. However, this will completely remove those countries that are in Imports sheet but not in Exports sheet which might lose useful information.\r\n\r\n15(b). As such, we will move all these null data to the default position of 0.\r\n\r\n16(a). Next, we will drag the Country/Regions to the filter tab to allow user to select the ** Month Year** that they would like to visualize. For starters, we will select all the countries and regions (This can be deselected later depends on user input).\r\n\r\n16(b). Once we have selected all the countries and regions. Click Apply and Ok. Next, we will click on the triangular button beside the Country/Regions tab under filter and click Show Filter. The filter should show up at the right side of the screen.\r\n\r\n17(a). Next, we will do the same for the Year/Month tab to allow user to select the month they want to visualize.\r\n\r\n17(b). This time round. There is no need to select all the month as we will be changing to single selection afterwards. We shall just click Apply and Ok.\r\n\r\n17(c). Same as the previous filter. We will show the filter. Then click on the triangular button on the Year/Month filter and select **Single Value (slider). This will allow the user to slide to the month that they want or even by clicking left and right on the slider to switch to the previous or next month.\r\n\r\n18(a). Next, we will see that there is a color legend of the SUM(%Surplus/Deficit) below our filters. Click on the triangular button and select Edit Colors. We would like to modify our colours to distinguish between surplus and deficit markers.\r\n\r\n18(b). To better distinguish between surplus and deficit, we will choose Red-Blue Diverging from the dropdown selection.\r\n\r\n18(c). Next, select the Use Full Color Range option to allow tableau to use the most extreme red and blue in regardless of the difference in value.\r\n\r\nAfter we have selected. Head towards the Country/Regions and select the following countries. Japan, Republic of Korea, Mainland China, Malaysia, United States, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia. Selecting a few countries will allow us to see the visualisation better.\r\n20(a). Notice that the markers are small in size. We shall enlarge the markers by adjusting the Size option under the Marks pane.\r\n\r\n20(b). Next, notice that some of the markers border are not easily seen due to being covered by other markers. As such, we will colourise the border by selecting a light grey color to further distinguish the markers.\r\n\r\n20(c). Next, we will change the transparency of the markers to further distinguish those markers being covered by other markers. The transparency of the markers will allow user to see the full circular markers.\r\n\r\n21(a). Next, we will see that on the %Surplus/Deficit colour legend on the bottom right of the page is in decimals. We will change that by going to the SUM(%Surplus/Deficit) and select format by clicking on the triangular button. \r\nSwitch to the Pane selection on the format panel. Under the Default section, change the Numbers to Percentage and select 0 decimal place.\r\n\r\nNext, we will change the chart size from Standard to Entire View to visualize the chart better.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish between Surplus or Deficit Marker. We will incorporate a 45 degree reference line. To make a reference line, we will create a new calculated field named Reference Line and input the formula [Export Values]\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the newly created field to the Rows section. Notice that a new chart with diagonal markers has been created below the original chart.\r\n\r\nNext, we will perform a dual axis by clicking on the triangular button on the SUM(Reference Line) tab. This will ensure the diagonal markers is located with the original chart.\r\n\r\nNotice that both axis are not of equal scale. we will do a synchronisation of the axis. By right clicking on the reference line scale and select Synchronise Axis.\r\n\r\nNext, we will remove the scale by deselecting the Show Header on the reference line scale option.\r\n\r\nAfterwhich, we will head towards the SUM(Reference Line) section under the Marks pane and change the design of the chart to line. You will notice that tableau will try to line up the reference line markers diagonally.\r\n\r\n30(a). To make the dotted reference line, we will right click on the reference marker on the chart and select trend line.\r\n\r\n30(b). A trend line should appear cutting diagonally along the chart.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the Country/Regions to the Label under the SUM(Import Values) in the Marks pane to show each selected country as label.\r\n\r\nThe label is in black color. To distinguish the label with the marker, we will right click on the Label box and under font, we will select Match Mark Color.\r\n\r\n33(a). Once, we are done with the design of the Total Merchandise Trade chart. We will move to Sheet 2. The purpose of Sheet 2 is to create a small Balance of Trade chart that will be incorporated into the Tooltip of the Total Merchandise Trade chart that we have previously developed.\r\n33(b). We will create a new calculated field for Balance of Trade by input the below formula.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the Year/Month to Columns section and Balance of Trade to Rows section. A time-series line chart should show up.\r\n\r\nNext, we will change the line chart to bar chart to make it easier to visualize in the tooltip.\r\n\r\n36(a). To fit into the tooltip. We will need to make the chart smaller. We will adjust the chart to the left upper side of the chart while making sure that each bar is still visible.\r\n36(b). Next, notice that the whole year is not visible. As such, we will rotate the label.\r\n\r\n36(c). To further reduce the size. We will remove the Year/Month field label by right clicking on the field label and select Hide Field Labels for Columns.\r\n\r\nNext, we will create a new field called Surplus or Deficit. This field will allow tableau to diffrentiate the difference between Surplus and Deficit. This will allow us to change the color of the bar chart later.\r\n\r\n38(a). Next, we will drag the newly created field to color. Tableau will diffrentiate Surplus and Deficit by colour.\r\n\r\n38(b). Notice, we are not able to change the colour for Deficit as there is no month and country selection. Tableau sum up all the trade numbers for each year.\r\n\r\n38(c). As such, we will again drag the Country/Regions to the filter to allow us to select the country. We will select both Brazil and Brunei which show us both Surplus and Deficit numbers. Next, we will change the color of both Surplus and Deficit by clicking on the triangular button on the color legend.\r\n\r\n38(d). Next, we will edit the colors. Click once on the Deficit and select a dark red colour by accessing red on the dragdown color palette. Do the same for Surplus by selecting a dark blue color.\r\n\r\nOnce we have completed with the Balance of Trade chart, we will rename the chart by double clicking on the sheet tab below to Balance of Trade (By year).\r\n\r\n40(a). Next, we will switch back to Sheet 1. To create our tooltip, we will need a few new calculated fields. First, we will create both %Surplus and %Deficit new fields. This two fields are required to differentiate between positive percentage trade surplus and negative percentage trade deficit. Refer to both the formula below.\r\n\r\n\r\n40(b). Next, we will create another two fields for Surplus and Deficit. These two fields will allow Tableau to differentiate between Positive Balance of Trade and Negative Balance of Trade. Refer to the two formulas below.\r\n\r\n\r\n40(c). Lastly, we will crate two more fields to differentiate between the word Surplus and Deficit. Refer to the two formulas below.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the required fields into the tooltip as shown below.\r\n\r\nThereafter, we will double click on the tooltip box and delete the whole default wordings. Then, we will input the following wordings as shown below. Note that the smaller font are in font 10 while the larger font are bold in font 14. The red and blue font is to allow tableau to differentiate between the two different fields. E.g. if the row is Surplus. The tooltip will only show the <AGG(Surplus Blue)>,<AGG(Surplus)>> and <<SUM(%Surplus)>> in blue and vice versa for Deficit.\r\n\r\nRemember that we have created a Balance of Trade chart previously. We will incorporate the chart into our tooltip by clicking on the insert button on the top left of the tooltip pop up box. We will next click the Sheet and select Balance of Trade.\r\n\r\nA new line should be incorporated in the dialog box. We will change the default size of 300 to 350 to fit our bar chart into the tooltip.\r\n\r\nNext, we will edit both of our import and export axis by adding S$(’1000) to show the real representation of the chart.\r\n\r\nUnder the Axis Titles. We shall add S$(’1000) to change the axis name. Do this for the export axis.\r\n\r\n47(a). Next, we will incorporate two annotations to show the upper triangle of the chart as Trade Deficit and lower triangle as Trade Surplus. To do this, we will need to right click on the chart and select Annotate.\r\n\r\n47(b). We shall add both Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit separately as shown below in our annotation dialog box.\r\n\r\n\r\n47(c). Next, we will move both the Trade Surplus and Trade Deficit to each end of the triangle as shown below.\r\n\r\nNext, if we hover our mouse to one of the markers. The tooltip will show all the whole values which is in millions and the %Surplus/Deficit in decimals. This is an inaccurate representation of the markers. First, the markers should be in billion. Second, the value should be represented with a $xxB for easier reading rather than showing whole numbers. Lastly, the percentage should be in % not decimal. As such, we will need to modify and amend our chart.\r\nWe will first create two new fields. These two fields will be named (Export Values S\\(B) and (Import Values S\\)B). Both fields will make use of the exisiting export and import values and mulitply each row by 1000 to show the accurate numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the newly created fields to replace the existing fields in the columns and rows section as shown below.\r\n\r\nNext, we will amend some of the existing fields by clicking on the triangular button and select edit that were affected by the change in export and import values.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will amend the Balance of Trade field by changing both export and import values to the new fields.\r\n\r\nNext, we will also amend the Total Trading Value field.\r\n\r\nNotice that the reference line has changed too as it is dependent on the export values. As such, we shall also amend the reference line formula by changing the former export value to the new field.\r\n\r\nNext, we will also amend the tooltip to remove the SGD($)(’1000) since we have change the import and export values to billions.\r\n\r\n56(a). Next, we will drag the new import and export value fields to the tooltip and switch the existing import and export value to the new fields.\r\n\r\n56(b). We will double click on the tooltip box and switch the existing import and export value to the new fields. Additionally, we will remove the SGD($)(’1000).\r\n\r\n56(c). Thereafter, we will check the tooltip again. Notice that the value have change to billion. To ease the reader on reading the tooltip, we will format the tooltip by changing to $B and also change the %Surplus/Deficit to percentage.\r\n\r\n57(a). To format the tooltip, we will first click on the button on the SUM(Export Values S$B) tab under the Marks** pane.\r\n\r\n57(b). Next, we will format the SUM(Export Values S\\(B) by first clicking on the pane, then change the default numbers to Currency(Custom). Thereafter, change the Display Unit to Billions (B). Do the same for SUM(Import Values S\\)B).\r\n\r\n57(c). Next, we will format AGG(Deficit). As deficit is naturally a negative value. As such, we shall Negative values to -$1234. Similarly, we will change the Display Unit to Billions. Repeat the same process for AGG(Surplus) but no change will be needed for Negative Values.\r\n\r\n57(d). Next, we will format SUM(%Deficit). By changing the defualt numbers to Percentage and decimals to 0 places. Repeat the same process for SUM(%Surplus).\r\n\r\n57(e). Lastly, we will format the ATTR(Year/Month) to the Month Year format so as to be consistent with the filter control.\r\n\r\n58(a). Next, we will change the axis label for both import and export values. To do this, we will need to right click on the Import Values S$B axis and click on Edit Axis.\r\n\r\n58(b). Next, the format panel will appear. Switch to the axis pane, and change the Scale Numbers to Number (Custom). Change the Decimal Places to 1 and Display Units to Billions (B). Repeat the same step for Export Values S$B.\r\n\r\n59(a). Next, we will double click on the trend line to edit the trend line. The purpose for this is to remove the tooltip that is associated with the trend line.\r\n\r\n59(b). Next, a trend line options will emerge. Unselect Show tooltips and Show recalculated line for highlighted or selected data points.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it. The first sheet has been completed. Rename the sheet to Singapore Merchandise Trade, January 2011 - December 2020. Note that, the sheet name is not finalized.\r\n\r\n4.4 Balance of Trade\r\nNext, we will start to create another sheet named Balance of Trade. This sheet is used to analyse the relationship between Balance of Trade and %Surplus/Deficit. We will drag the %Surplus/Deficit to the columns section and Balance of Trade to the rows section.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag Country/Regions to detail box under Marks pane. A scatterplot will be formed based on countries and regions.\r\n\r\nNext, notice that there are null values. Same as before, we will show the data at default position of 0. Note that there are two nulls to be place in default value of 0.\r\n\r\nNext, we will place the Year/Month and Country/Regions tab on the filter in order to filter out the selected countries. Once we have done that, click the show filter for both tabs.\r\n\r\nNext, to sync selection of one sheet to be the same as another. We will switch to the Singapore Merchandise Trade, January 2011 - December 2020 and click on the triangular button on the Country/Regions and Year/Month and go to Apply to Worksheets and select All Using This Data Source.\r\n\r\nWe will then go back to Sheet 3 after our filter selection. Next, we will change our chart design to circle to show the bubble plot.\r\n\r\nAfter which, we will drag the Total Trading Value to the Size box to let tableau display the size of the circle by total trading value.\r\n\r\nNext, drag the %Surplus/Deficit to the Color box and edit the colors by choosing the Red-Blue Diverging and click the Use Full Color Range.\r\n\r\nAs the circle seems small. We will enlarge the size to the next size mark to make the markers more visible.\r\n\r\nNext, we will label each marker with Country/Regions by dragging the Country/Regions to the Label box under the Marks pane.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the fields highlighted below to the tooltip. To allow us to format required fields later.\r\n\r\nWe will delete the default wordings and type down the wordings as shown below. Note that the small font is font 10 while the bigger bold font are in font 14.\r\n\r\n73(a). Same as before, we will format the fields in the tooltip. For AGG(Surplus) as shown below, we will change the Display Units to Billions (B).\r\n\r\n73(b). As for AGG(Deficit). We will change the Negative Values to -$1234 and Display Units to Billions (B).\r\n\r\n73(c). For SUM(%Surplus). We will change the to percentage with the decimal places amend to 0.\r\n\r\n73(d). For ATTR(Year/Month). We will change the date format to March 2001 to be consistent with our filter control.\r\n\r\n74(a). Next, we will change our Apply to Worksheets tab to selected worksheets. This is to prevent the Balance of Trade (By year) to be sync with the rest of the selection. The Balance of Trade (By year) purpose is to display the whole 10 years in the tooltip.\r\n\r\n74(b). We will deselect the Balance of Trade (By year).\r\n\r\nOnce, we are done with the tooltip. We will edit the axis. Same as previously, we will right click on the Balance of Trade axis to edit axis. Remember to change to the Axis pane. Change the Scale Numbers to Currency (Custom) and the Decimal Places to 1.\r\n\r\nNext, we will change the axis for %Surplus/Deficit to Percentage and change the Decimal Places to 0.\r\n\r\nNext, we will hide the card of the AGG(Total Trading Value) as there is no need to refer to the size of the marker. We can check the value via the tooltips.\r\n\r\nSame as before. We will adjust the transparency of the markers to 70% and select the grey color option for the border. This will make the markers more visible.\r\n\r\nNext, we will make the zero lines more visible. By right clicking on the chart and select format. Go to the Lines option under the Format Lines tab and thicken the zero lines and choose a darker grey color as shown below.\r\n\r\nLastly, Rename the sheet to Balance of Trade and we have completed the design for this sheet.\r\n4.5 SG Import & Export\r\nWe will next move to the last sheet. The purpose of the last sheet is to create a chart similar to the parallel coordinates plot to show the export and import value of a country via a line. First, we will drag the Measure Names and Measure Values to Columns and Rows respectively.\r\n\r\nWe will some of the fields in the Measure Values and retain only Export Values S\\(B and Import Values S\\)B.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the Country/Regions and Year/Month to the filter tab.\r\n\r\nWe will switch back to the Singapore Merchandise Trade, January 2011 - December 2020 and select Sheet 4 to allow the usage of the same filter for selected worksheets.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the Country/Regions to detail and %Surplus/Deficit to color. This will show the selected countries in the chart and also differentiate them by their %surplus or % deficit value.\r\n\r\nSame as before. We will edit colors under the color legend to Red-Blue Diverging and select Use Full Color Range. This will allow the same colors to be use throughout the different sheets.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the Country/Regions to label to label the countries in the chart.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the fields as shown below into the tooltip.\r\n\r\nWe will change the tooltip wordings to the wordings as shown below to display useful information such as the export values and import values.\r\n\r\nNext, we will format the axis by right clicking on the Value axis and change the Scale Numbers to Currency (Custom), Decimal Places to 1 and Display Units to Billions (B).\r\n\r\nNext, we will format the SUM(%Surplus/Deficit) to Percentage and Decimal Places to 0.\r\n\r\nNotice that the direction for export and import values are wrong. It should be blue when export values are higher than import value. To amend this, we shall change the position of the SUM(Export Values S\\(B) and SUM(Import Values S\\)B) in the Measure Values pane.\r\n\r\nNext, we will rename the Import Values S\\(B and Export Values S\\)B to Import and Export since the y-axis is already labelled as Values.\r\n\r\nNext, we will input the dots on the end of the line by clicking on the Color box and selecting the line with dots.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will change the size of the line to a bit larger to make the lines more visible. We will also rename the sheet name to Import & Export (By Countries)\r\n\r\n4.6 Dashboard\r\nNow, we will combined all the charts together in a dashboard. We will open a new dashboard by clicking on the dashboard icon beside the new sheet tab. Next, we will change the Screen Size to Automatic to allow tableau to automatically fit the screen.\r\n\r\nNext, we will move the sheets to its desired location as shown below. We will also rename the first sheet, Singapore Merchandise Trade, January 2011 - December 2020 to Singapore Merchandise Trade, Jan 2011 - Dec 2020 so that the title will not need to end on the second line.\r\n\r\nTo allow interactivity where the user select one marker, the same marker from the other sheets will be highlighted as well. We will go to the Actions under the Worksheet tab.\r\n\r\nUnder the Add Action tab, select Highlight.\r\n\r\nNext, under the Source Sheets and Target Sheets, select Dashboard 1 for both options to allow all sheets to interact with each other.\r\n\r\nNext, we will rename the first sheet to allow the month to change based on the user selection.\r\n\r\nWe will do the same for both Balance of Trade and Import & Export (By Country). For Import and Export (By Country), we will additionally add a SG on the front and remove (By Country) at the back.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we will add a caption below the dashboard. First, we will select the text object and drag it to the middle bottom of the chart until the bottom portion is shaded.\r\n\r\nA dialog box will pop up. We will type down the source and dataset in the caption.\r\n\r\nNext, we will drag the text object all the way down to the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nNext, we will incorporate Animations to the chart so that users can see the movement of the markers more fluidly and interactively.\r\n\r\nOn the Animations pane. We will select On and also change the Duration to 1.00 seconds to make the movement time just right.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will incorporate a dashboard name. Select the Show Dashboard Title at the bottom left of the screen and type Singapore Merchandise Trade, Janurary 2011 - December 2020 with bold letters.\r\n\r\nLastly, we will remove the %Surplus/Deficit of the color legend and enlarge the Country/Regions selection a bit to allow more visibility of the countries.\r\n\r\nThe dashboard will be publish in Tableau Public. Usually, there will be some differences between Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public. In our case, the markers are too big as shown below.\r\n\r\nAs such, we will minimize the size for both the Singapore Merchandise Trade and Balance of Trade\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will also add a caption to give some insights to the users using the visualisation. The caption will share about Taiwan increasing trade deficit and also Thailand increasing trade surplus. This will be articulated more in section 5.0 below.\r\n\r\nThe finalized visualisation will looks like this in Tableau Public. Access the link [here] (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chee.hong/viz/SingaporeMerchandiseTradeJan2011-Dec2020/Dashboard1)\r\n\r\n5.0 Observations from the data visualisation\r\nSingapore’s Balance of Trade with Indonesia has been decreasing from year of 2011 to 2020. In 2011, the Balance of Trade exceeded S$30B. In October 2011, the Balance of Trade hit a record 172% trade surplus. However, the Balance of Trade has been decreasing to around S$10B in 2020 possibly due to the impact of Covid-19. This is with an exception of 2018 where there is an increase in Balance of Trade between Indonesia to around S$23B. However, Indonesia remains among one of the highest trade partners of Singapore in terms of Balance of Trade.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Singapore’s Balance of Trade with United States although has been in the red from 2011 to 2019 with the lowest %deficit of -56% recorded in November 2011. The Balance of trade has been increasing slowly where it reaches a positive Balance of Trade of around S$5B in 2020 from a low of around -S$22B in 2011, 2012 and 2014. In 2020, the highest recorded Balance of Trade with the US is S$2.12B which represented 56% of trade surplus. See below two images for more info.\r\n\r\n\r\n3)Singapore’s trade with Taiwan has seen an increase in Trade Deficit from 2011 of around S$9B to 2020 of around S$24B. Singapore has not experience any Trade Surplus from trade with Taiwan within this 10 years. The largest percentage deficit recorded for trade with Taiwan is on May 2019 where the Balance of Trade is -S$2.36B which resulted in a 60% of trade deficit. Although Singapore balance of trade with taiwan has been increasing. There is a decrease from 2015 to 2016 where it starts to increase again in 2017.\r\n\r\n4(a) Singapore’s balance of trade with Malaysia has been decreasing since 2011 of S$14B to 2020 -$12B. Singapore experience a trade surplus from 2011 to 2018 where this has since change to trade deficit from 2019 to 2020. The interesting to note is from 2019 to 2020. There is a sharp increase of 1100% in trade deficit, from S-$1B to S$12B. This might be due to increase imports for daily necessities from Malaysia during the COVID-19 period whereas export to Malaysia has since slow down due to the border restrictions between the two countries.\r\n4(b) The lowest trade deficit with Malaysia is in June 2020 where there is a -S$1.58B of trade deficit which accounted to a 30% of deficit\r\n\r\nSingapore’s trade with Thailand has seen an increase since 2011 to 2019. However, there is a sharp drop in 2020. This sharp drop might be due to COVID-19 situation where factory output might have an impact to the trade from both side. The highest trade surplus percentage was recorded in November 2019 where there is a 182% surplus which amounted to $1.35B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Crtique of Original Data Visualization\r\n\r\nThe above data visualisation is created using the datasets downloaded from the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market provided by the Department of Statistic, Singapore (DOS).\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\nOverlapping density plots might confuse the reader into thinking that there are three different components being measured.\r\nThe Dual-axis density plots are not synchronised resulting in two different scales being measured. This will provide false information to the reader into thinking that one measured component is higher/lower than the other.\r\nEach country y-axis(Export/Import) has different scale which make it difficult for readers to compare. E.g. Japan in reality has lower overall merchandise trade than Mainland China. However, the above chart seems to show both having almost the same trade value.\r\nThe year of interest should be from 2019-2020 based on the title given. However, there are charts that extend to 2021 and also charts with missing years such as Japan.\r\nThere is no annotations or labeling available to indicate important values and information derived from the chart.\r\nThere is no sub-title/caption to share any insights retrieved from the graph. The sub-title will play a part in allowing the reader the important takeaway from the chart.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nAs this is a time-series data, it will be better to arrange the chart into quarter or months at the x-axis instead of just years to have a more accurate representation of the value. Additionally, it will be easier to identify the start to the end of the year by using quarter or month to represent each year.\r\nThe usage of density plots covers the tick marks that represented the y-axis. This might prevent the user from easily referencing a point to a value.\r\nTitle is too small. It should be big and in clear black font to show the title of the visualization clearly.\r\nThe x-axis scale of each country are different. E.g., Mainland China and Malaysia has a wider x-axis scale while HK, Taiwan and US have a narrower scale. This does not give an accurate representation and comparison between the countries. It shows that there is sharper increase/decrease in value in countries that has narrower scale than those that are of wider scale.\r\nUS should be renamed to United States to show its full name. This is to have consistency with the rest of the countries. For example, Hong Kong is not labeled by its acronym H.K.\r\n2.0 Proposed data visualisation design\r\n\r\nThe above proposed design incorporated a line chart separated between the six countries and both years for a clearer and cleaner view of the chart.\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nLike the original design, both export and import are in the same pane differentiated by country and year. However, instead of using a overlapping density plot, a line chart is used which reduces unnecessary data-ink. This proposed design is very clean and clear as there is no overlap in the chart. Readers will be able to read the chart without any confusion.\r\nLike the original design, the proposed design uses the dual axis too. However, both import and export scales are synchronized, and the right scale has been hidden to enlarge the visualization for better viewing. As such, the chart would not look skewed. Readers will be able to compare both import and export of a country in the same pane. At the same time, readers can compare with other countries easily.\r\nThe y-axis scale is the same throughout the whole chart.\r\nAs stated in the title, the year of interest is 2019-2020. The chart has been split into 2019 and 2020 too for readers to easily examine all six countries across the same year and reference upwards or downwards to the other year.\r\nAnnotations and labeling will be provided to highlight important information derived from the chart.\r\nSub-title/ Caption will be available to clearly show the important takeaways derived from the chart.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nThe x-axis is represented by month. The line chart will also be accompanied with dots to allow user to easily reference the point from a particular month to a value.\r\nWith the usage of line charts, the tick-marks are more easily visible for better referencing.\r\nThe title is big and clear to allow readers to understand the intent of the chart.\r\nThe x-axis represented by month has the same scale (relative lengths) throughout the chart, this will provide accuracy and not skewed charts. As such, readers will not be deceive into thinking that a particular chart has a steeper rate of change in value due to it being skewed.\r\nUS will be changed to United States to show consistency with the names of the other five countries.\r\nEach line graph is directly labeled to allow user to know the identity of its line instead of the need to reference to a legend.\r\n3.0 Data Visualisation\r\nThe completed data visualisation using tableau desktop can be accessed through here. Do note to select full screen to have better visibility of the chart.\r\n4.0 Step-by-step data visualisation process\r\n4.1 Data Preparation\r\nDownload and open the excel file downloaded from the sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market provided by the Department of Statistic, Singapore (DOS). The original excel file is as shown below with two major sheets “T1” and “T2” subsequently renamed to “Imports” and “Exports.”\r\n\r\nMove the Variables and Year/Month columns to the first row.\r\n\r\nOpen Tableau Prep Builder and connect to the excel file. Drag the exports sheet to the working diagram and select out the variables of interest.\r\n\r\nNext, keep only the 6 countries of interest in the cleaning step and check for any missing data.\r\n\r\nAfter checking the final dataset, modify the dataset to make it into three columns namely Country (Exports), Month/Year and Export Values by the method of pivoting. Repeat step 4.1.3 to 4.1.5 with Import’s sheet.\r\n\r\nThe final prepared process will look like this below. We will next export out the prepared datasets to excel.\r\n\r\n4.2 Data Visualisation\r\nConnect tableau with the cleaned datasets. Link both Exports and Imports data via Country and Year/Month. Change the 3 columns for both dataset to their appropriate datatype.\r\n\r\nNext we will begin to create the chart. With the same design in mind, The country and month will be input as columns while the Year, Sum(Export values) and Sum(Import values) will be input as rows. Below is the result.\r\n\r\nTo positioned both Imports and Exports in the same pane for better comparison and visualisation. A dual axis will be performed on SUM (Export Values) and SUM (Import Values). Both axes will thereafter be synchronised to provide an accurate representation of the data.\r\n\r\nNext the measured names will be removed and each line will be fixed with a label directly. The label is coloured to show distinction between the two measured values. This will also widen the chart for better viewing and also allow the user to understand the representation of each line directly.\r\n\r\nTo further widen the whole chart, the “Sum of Import Values” scale will be hidden and the “Sum of Export Values” will be renamed to “Import/Export Values $(‘000)”. Additionally, changes were made to the countries on the x-axis to remove the (Thousand Dollars) and renamed the Year/Month to Month and Country (Exports) to Countries to better represent the x-axis.\r\n\r\nNext, dots were outline on the line chart to better relate the value with each year/month.\r\n\r\nNext, the highest trade value will be highlighted to exhibit the highest value. The following code will be used to highlight the value. The highest point will then be highlighted in red.\r\n\r\nAfterwhich, the newly created “Highest Export Value” will be dragged to colours to provide distinction between the Highest Value and the rest of the chart for both years.\r\n\r\nNext, the highest trade value will be labelled. As the labeling has been done before for Export and Import. We could not do another labeling for the max value. As such, the sheet will be transited to dashboard to physically label as text. Additionally, a dotted line has been included to highlight the month of interest.\r\n9(a) Of note, a duplicate of the export values using ‘circle’ chart and thereafter dual-axis can solve the problem of labeling the highest value. However, dual-axis has already been utilized in this chart.\r\n\r\nNext, an annotation will be included on the highest trade value to indicate that both highest trade value happen on August of both years with Mainland China. The annotation has been formatted to show borders for better visibility.\r\n\r\nNext, we will create annotation for the month of January 2020 to April 2020 for the trades with Malaysia to show that there is a steep decrease in trade value. Annotation is also included to indicate the steep decrease in trade values.\r\n11(a) Of note, a reason for the decrease in trades between Singapore and Malaysia might be due to the border closure caused by Covid-19. To avoid, the Storytelling bug as part of the Three Bugs of Chart Interpretation, the possible reason will not be included in the annotation.\r\n\r\nNext, we will highlight the gradual increase of Singapore trade with Taiwan for the year of 2020. The reason for this annotation is to show that Taiwan is the only country that seemingly having a gradual increase in trades with Singapore as compared to the other five countries.\r\n\r\nNext, we will include the title and sub-title/caption. Additionally, the tooltip will also be removed to minimize any interactivity present in the charts.\r\n 14. Finally, we will do some minor tweaks by 1) removing the countries/month 2) correct the symbol and enlarge the font of the highest trade value and 3) minimise the y-axis to further widen the chart. Additionally, the source and dataset will be added. Thereafter, the draft visualisation is completed.\r\n\r\n14(a) Do note that the above visualisation is not finalized. The reason being that there is some disorientation when the dashboard is published to Tableau Public. See below for the disoriented dashboard in Tableau Public.\r\n\r\nAs such we will make some changes to the dashboard. 1) Remove the dotted line indicator to indicate the month of interest. 2) The annotation will be change to area type instead of mark type. The finalized visualisation is as shown below.\r\n\r\nThe visualisation can be assessed from this link. Do note that there will be some minor differences between the visualisation from Tableau Desktop and Tableau Public due to the difference in aspect ratio etc.\r\n5.0 Observations from the data visualisation\r\n5.1 Three Major Observations\r\nSingapore ’s import from Hong Kong for both years is way lower than its export as compared to other countries.\r\nThe highest trade value of around S$7B in 2019 and around S$8B in 2020 is during the month of August with Mainland China.\r\nMalaysia trade with Singapore has a steep decrease in the month of Jan 2020 to Apr 2020.
